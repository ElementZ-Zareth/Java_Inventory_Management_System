# Java and JavaFX Scene Builder - Inventory Management System - Complete School Project

Built using Java (Netbeans IDE), JavaFX Scene Builder.  This school
project was my final Assessment for Software 1.  Recieved a Pass on
first submit.

Features:
GUI with two sections, "Parts" and "Products"
Ability to Add, Modify, and Delete from both sections.
Ability to dynamically Search each section by name.

Add Part brings up new window, adding "In-House" or "Outsourced".  Each
field must be complete to Save.  Hitting Cancel brings up a prompt "Are
you sure you want to exit?"  Cannot enter invalid characters in
numerical fields.

Add Product brings up a new window allowing the creation of new
Products.  Each product can contain multiple parts (requiring at least
one).  The "ID" field is automatically generated via random unused
number and cannot be edited.

Both windows will not allow you to save if all fields aren't entered,
prompts the user with error messages.
